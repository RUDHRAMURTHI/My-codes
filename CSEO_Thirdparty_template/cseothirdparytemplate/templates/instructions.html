    <div class="main-content">
        <h2> Before Uploading:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
              Download and install the "Azure DevOps OfficeÂ® Integration 2019" form "Other Tools and Frameworks" section in
              <a target="_blank" style="color:#000066; text-decoration: underline" aria-label="visual studio downloads. Opens in new tab" href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">visual studio downloads</a>
          </li>
          <li>
              From Azure Devops, query the required Application.
              Your query should contain only columns: "ID", "Title", "Repro Steps", "Severity", "State", "Tags"
          </li>
          <li>Your query should be sorted by "Severity" in Descending order. Now save your query with appropriate name.</li>
          <li>Now form more options(...) select 'Export in Excel' option, excel will be automatically opened.
              The excel now will be in Unusable format so ignore the first column in excel and copy all the rest and paste it in new excel sheet.
          </li>
          <li>Now your excel is ready to upload</li>
        </ol>
        <h2> After Downloading:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
              The Downloaded excel will not have the required styles, You have to make the necessary styling for the columns which contains links.
          </li>
          <li>
              The columns which contains links are: "ID", "MAS Reference" and "WCAG Reference".
          </li>
          <li>As this application accuracy depends mainly on the bugs alignment that where logged in Azure Devops,
              I suggest careful review of spaces in repro steps of the bugs before uploading template and after downloading template, quickly review everything is copied correctly or not.
          </li>
          <li>
              However don't worry I will be providing a extra column in the downloaded excel which contains both MAS reference and WCAG Reference,
              for review purpose, if anything is missed you can copy paste from by using this column without going to the bug in Azure Devops.
          </li>
          <li>If you make mistake in alignment while logging the bugs it will reflect here so do quality bug logging and Happy using this Application!</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
